          <h2>About ArchivesSpace</h2>
          <p>
          ArchivesSpace is an open source archives information management application designed to manage information about special collections material such as archives, manuscripts and digital objects.
          </p>
          <p>
          ArchivesSpace provides centralized access to detailed descriptions of archival and manuscript collections held in various repositories at Emory. Finding\aids describe our unique primary resources and help researchers determine if collections contain material of interest to them and exactly where that material is located. ArchivesSpace includes finding aids for both processed and unprocessed collections at the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library, the Emory University Archives, Oxford College Archives, Woodruff Health Sciences Center Library Historical Collections, Pitts Theology Library Special Collections and Archives and the Emory Law School Archives.
