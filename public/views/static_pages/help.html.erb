        <h2>ArchivesSpace Search Tips</h2>
          <p>The add row feature (+ icon) will let you construct a more complex search by adding additional search parameters and allowing you to apply And, Or, or Not operators to your search.</p>
          <p>To search an exact phrase, put quotation marks around the phrase.</p>
          <p>Searches are not case sensitive.</p>
          <p>An asterisk can use used as a wildcard character, so a search for librar* will give you results for library, libraries, librarian, etc.</p>
          <p>To browse the collections by Emory Library, Collection title, Subjects, or Names click on the category above the search bar.</p>
          <p>A reminder that ArchivesSpace searches words and phrases used in the finding aids that describe collections, not the words and phrases that appear in documents in the collections themselves. ArchivesSpace only searches finding aids for archives and mansuscripts, it does not search rare books.</p>

        <h2>Glossary of ArchivesSpace terms</h2>
          <p><strong>Archives</strong> are materials created or received by a person, family, or organization that are preserved because of the enduring value of the information they contain.</p>
          <p><strong>Collections</strong> are groups of materials assembled by a person, family, organization, or repository. For example, the Salman Rushdie papers is a collection of materials created or used by Salman Rushdie.</p>
          <p><strong>Containers</strong> are anything that houses or stores archival materials such as a box or a folder.</p>
          <p><strong>Digital records</strong> are born-digital and digitized materials. Some of these may be available online, but donor restrictions, copyright considerations, and personal privacy considerations means that many of these materials are only available in our reading rooms.</p>
          <p><strong>Finding aids</strong> are guides that allow users to discover, understand, and access archival collections. Finding aids describe the creation, arrangement, content, and context of archival materials.</p>
          <p><strong>Names</strong> are the people, families, and organizations that create archival materials.</p>
          <p><strong>Repositories</strong> are institutions that hold archival materials, here at Emory they are the different Libraries that contain archives and manuscript materials.</p>
          <p><strong>Series</strong> are sets of material within a collection that either were created as part of the same activity (like files related to someone’s work on a committee) or are of the same type (like correspondence files or speech files).</p>
          <p><strong>Subjects</strong> record the main topics that archival collections are about. Subjects also include places and the formats of materials.</p>
          </br>
        <h2>Copyright/Using and publishing from collections</h2>
          <p>Researchers should be aware that the copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) provides protection for unpublished materials as well as for published works. It is your responsibility as a researcher to use materials from the collections in a manner that complies with U.S. copyright law.</p>
          <p>Manuscript collections from the 20th and 21st centuries may contain sensitive or private information. Emory University's special collections libraries strive to identify and restrict or remove all private and confidential information in our collections. However, there may be instances where researchers find materials containing private or confidential information. Users of Emory University's special collections libraries must agree to not disclose, make public, or publish in any format confidential information discovered while using our collections.<p>
